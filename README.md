Welcome to the home of the UUG, JMU's
[2nd best penguin club](https://beinvolved.jmu.edu/organization/prevetsociety).
The UUG is a group of Linux and Unix-like operating system users, as well
as other open-source software users based at James Madison University. We work
alongside [several other clubs](https://wiki.cs.jmu.edu/student/clubs/start)
in JMU's Computer Science department to provide a forum for education and
advocacy in the FOSS ecosystem.

## Meetings

When JMU classes are in session, our meetings are Wednesday nights in the
ISAT/CS building and are open to all to attend. We also hold occasional meetings
on WebEx outside the semester and during global pandemics. For an invitation to
an online meeting, contact an officer or subscribe to our mailing list. For

The UUG publishes a virtual appliance version of Linux Mint. The VM has been
preconfigured with software for many JMU Computer Science courses. Please see:

## Governance

The UUG is run by a team of advisers and

according to our [constitution](https://github.com/jmunixusers/constitution/).
