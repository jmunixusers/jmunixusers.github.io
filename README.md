# JMU Unix Users Group

Welcome to the JMU UUG homepage, JMU's
[2nd best penguin club](https://beinvolved.jmu.edu/organization/prevetsociety).
The UUG is a group of Linux and Unix-like operating system users, as well
as other open-source software users based at James Madison University. We
provide a forum for education and advocacy in the FOSS ecosystem.
