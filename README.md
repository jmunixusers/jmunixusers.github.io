Welcome to the home of the UUG, JMU's
[2nd best penguin club](https://beinvolved.jmu.edu/student_community?club_id=65967).
The UUG is a group of Linux and Unix-like operating system users, as well
as other open-source software users based at James Madison University. We work
alongside [several other clubs](https://wiki.cs.jmu.edu/student/clubs/start)
in JMU's Computer Science department to provide a forum for education and
advocacy in the FOSS ecosystem.
